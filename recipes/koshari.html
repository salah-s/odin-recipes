    <br><h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Soak Dry Lentils and Dry Chickpeas Ahead of Time</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried lentils and dried chickpeas in water for 3 hours prior to making koshari.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Prepare the chickpeas</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Boil the dried chickpeas until semi-cooked (about 45 minutes to an hour). Drain water. Add fresh water and the ground cumin. Boil chickpeas a second time for another 30 minutes. Once chickpeas are cooked, squeeze the lime over the chickpeas.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Fry the onions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the onions into circles. Mix with flour and set aside for 30 minutes prior to frying.</li>
        <li>Fry in oil, preferably sunflower oil. Using a frying spatula, remove the onions from the oil. Set onto a paper towel and set aside. Salt as desired. Keep the sunflower oil to use some of it in other parts of the recipe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Make the fresh red sauce (optional)</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, and garlic cloves in the food processor. If you would like a spicy sauce, add 1 spicy pepper. Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, oil (from the fried onions), lime juice, salt, and pepper. Blend and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Make the Koshari Lentil Rice</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the onions in a food processor. In a high-rimmed stovetop pot, add the oil (from the fried onions). Cook the blended onions slowly on low heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the drained brown lentils (these will be about 2.25 cups after being soaked) and water. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes covered, or until they soften.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to medium-low. Add the short-grain rice, salt, and pepper. Mix the koshari rice and cook on medium-low heat covered until the rice is tender (about 12 to 15 minutes). Turn off the stove and allow the rice to rest covered for 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cook the pasta</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water and add about 1 tablespoon of salt. Break the spaghetti pasta in half, then break the half again making quarter-size sections of spaghetti. Break about 15 spaghetti noodles at the same time.</li>
        <li>Add the spaghetti pasta and elbow pasta to the boiling water. Cook the pasta until desired firmness. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Koshari Vinegar Red Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the tomatoes in a blender. Strain tomatoes into a bowl. Alternatively, use canned tomato passata (see note 7). Mince the garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Fry oil (or ghee) with 1 teaspoon chili flakes (or chili powder) for 30 seconds then add the minced garlic cloves. Add the tomato paste and vinegar for about 30 seconds before adding the blended tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, sugar, and ground black pepper. simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
